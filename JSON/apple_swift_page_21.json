For example `#if arch(x86_64) || arch(ppc64)` should evaluates to `true` for `x86_64` target even while `ppc64` is not valid argument for `arch()` platform condition. The issue was introduced in #7955. This is a regression that breaks existing code. e.g. https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/1026\r\n**Scope:** Affects `#if` and `#elseif` condition which contains unsupported arguments for platform condition`os()`, `arch()`, and `_endian()`\r\n**SR Issue:** N/A\r\n**Risk:** Low\r\n**Testing:** Added test cases.",
