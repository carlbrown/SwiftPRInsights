NSNumbers were (before this PR) type-opaque, so an `NSNumber(value: true)` -> `\"1\"`.\r\n\r\nI resolved this by first rewriting the type checking code to use a pattern match so the intention was clearer, then added a special case for the primitive bool case. The switch statement should be a clear set of entry points for future maintainers, following the JSON spec.\r\n\r\nNext, I implemented objCType for NSNumber. This allows us to correctly discover when an NSNumber is in use boxing a boolean and encode it properly.\r\n\r\nAs I write this, I realise that we need to:\r\n- [x] tighten up the _NSObjCType assignments in the NSNumber initialiser to correctly reflect `Long` etc.\r\n\r\nFuture work, which could be included in this PR as it is relatively trivial but definitely out of scope of the bug is to:\r\n1. Differentiate between Integers and Numbers as per the JSON spec (yes, they're different!) by inspecting NSNumber\r\n2. Rewrite the pattern match code to stop using `_SwiftValue.store` and use something less obtuse e.g. type checking.\r\n\r\nLonger term I think this code could do with some protocol oriented restructuring, which I would like to discuss with the code owner, whoever they are!\r\n",

This PR adds a number of tests to show the problem, and fixes a number of issues:\r\n- The contract was different from Foundation. Methods were not optional and NSError was still in use.\r\n- There was an incorrect nullability annotation on the C Shim between libxml2. This was causing a crash when processing namespaces.\r\n- The `bomChunk` parsing was broken. There was no way for the parser to actually be constructed.\r\n- Some of the logic as to what values get reported to `startElement` and `endElement` I believe was wrong. I had trouble fixing the logic for the nullability changes and decided that it was easier to re-write things.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of code in this file hasn't been spruced up in a while and doesn't follow many swift best practices. I'm not sure what the policy was on cleaning things up was, so I tried to just focus on my bugs. However I would be surprised if a cleanup didn't find a few more issues.\r\n\r\nBrian King\r\n",
