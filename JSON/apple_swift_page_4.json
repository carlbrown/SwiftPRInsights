This was safe since we were performing a copy_block on the block\r\nand destroying the SSA value of the non-yet blockified function. This looks like\r\na double consume to the ownership verifier. To fix this, I changed the bridging\r\ncode to use a new entrypoint for storing on SILGenBuilder that just does the\r\nright thing by forwarding the cleanup on the SSA value and transfering it to the\r\naddress. This means the address will be destroyed instead of the SSA value,\r\nyielding proper ownership.\r\n\r\nrdar://31880847",

      "body": "- **Explanation**: In today's Swift, only non-optional function parameters can be non-escaping (and are by default). However, Objective-C *does* allow applying its `noescape` attribute to a callback block marked `nullable`. This patch pokes a very narrow hole into the override checking to accomodate this: if a declaration comes from Objective-C, and it has an optional, non-escaping closure parameter, it's okay to override it in Swift with an optional, escaping closure parameter. This isn't strictly safe because a caller could be relying on the non-escaping-ness, but we don't have anything better for now. (This behavior will probably be deprecated in the future.)\r\n- **Scope**: Affects overrides of methods that are (1) imported from Objective-C (2) with block parameters (3) that are both nullable and non-escaping.\r\n- **Issue**: rdar://problem/32903155\r\n- **Reviewed by**: @jckarter  \r\n- **Risk**: Low. Relaxes existing conditions under very specific circumstances. Any existing code should continue to work.\r\n- **Testing**: Added new C++ unit tests and Swift regression tests.",

Now we check the decl context to make sure that doesn't happen.\r\n- **Scope**: Only affects C declarations within Objective-C containers (classes, protocols, and categories).\r\n- **Issue**: rdar://problem/32451417\r\n- **Reviewed by**: @DougGregor   \r\n- **Risk**: Low. This is technically a breaking change in non-asserts builds, because the struct really could be found via member lookup.
