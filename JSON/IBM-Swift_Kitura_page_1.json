No functionality was changed.\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\nTested on Mac and Linux. A new negative test case was added as well.\n## Checklist:\n\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\n\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

      "body": "As the title describes, this is a refactoring / renaming of the HTTPServerDelegate class protocol in Kitura-net to simply ServerDelegate. Changes apply to both Kitura and Kitura-net, both on the master branch.\n\nIn relation to #565 - adding FastCGI to Kitura.\n## Description\n- Pulled HTTPServerDelegate from the HTTPServer class.\n- Placed it in it's own file, ServerDelegate.swift in Kitura-net.\n- Replaced all uses of HTTPServerDelegate with ServerDelegate system wide. This affects both the Kitura-Net and Kitura projects.\n## Motivation and Context\n\nThis class will ultimately be used to provide server protocols other than HTTP and will be used by a forthcoming pull request related to adding a FastCGI server implementation to Kitura. For clarity, this refactor makes it obvious that the ServerDelegate handles more than HTTP and moves it out of the HTTPServer class in the process.\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\nChange is relatively trivial in terms of a refactor. Did a full rebuild of current test projects I'm working on and everything builds and runs as always. There is no real code changes here - just renames for the most part.\n## Checklist:\n\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\n\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

Eliminate the use of dispatch_main\n## Description\n\nExploit the new waitOnListeners API in KituraNet.HTTPServer instead of invoking dispatch_main.\n\n**Note:** It is important that this PR not be merged before the PR https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-net/pull/43 is merged.\n## Motivation and Context\n\nOn Linux processes running Kitura used to get marked as defunct. This prevented:\n1. The use of LLDB to debug\n2. Getting core files when Kitura crashed\n3. Tools like top didn't report useful information\n\nThis was apparently due to the way dispatch_main is implemented on Linux.\n\nThis is issue IBM-Swift/Kitura#417\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\nTested as part of the performance test work, ran Kitura under lldb, and have successfully gotten core files when Kitura processes crash.\n## Checklist:\n\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\n\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.
