Create a separate internal computed property `internal var serializationString: String` to return the proper formatted string \n- check whether or not the underlying store is a _cfObject is a fractionDigit type which need leading zero padding and conditionally use a custom formatter string  `\"0.###############\"`. \n  \n  Reason for using custom format string instead of existing style was largely due to the documentation and programing guide suggestions on the fact exact  formats of this sort should be decoupled from Locale \n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFDataFormatting/Articles/dfCreatingCFNumberFormatters.html\n\n> To create a CFNumberFormatter, you must specify a locale and a formatter style as illustrated in Listing 1, or a format string, as shown in Listing 2. Format styles do not specify an exact format—they depend on the locale, user preference settings, and operating system version. If you want to specify an exact format, use the CFNumberFormatterSetFormat function to set the format string, and the CFNumberFormatterSetProperty function to change specific properties such as separators, the \"Not a number\" symbol, and the padding character.\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreFoundation/Reference/CFNumberFormatterRef/#//apple_ref/doc/constant_group/Number_Formatter_Styles\n\n> The format for these number styles is not exact because they depend on the locale, user preference settings, and operating system version. Do not use these constants if you want an exact format (for example, if you are parsing data in a given format). In general, however, you are encouraged to use these styles to accommodate user preferences.\n",
