All public APIs have docstrings and I also added a section to the README with tips and tricks. The class is fully available on `iOS`, `OSX` and `tvOS` but not `watchOS`. The podspec has been updated to reflect the `watchOS` omission.\n\nOne important callout is that the default socket address uses IPv6. Other than that, the logic is fairly similar to `AFNetworking`. I added a bit more functionality around the `Listener` closure by allowing you to specify the `dispatch_queue_t` the closure is called on.\n",

The timings are collected at various points throughout the lifecycle of the request.\n\nAlamofire can now report the latency, request duration and total duration of any `Request`.

      "body": "This PR extends the `SessionDelegate` override closures to include variants that contain the `completionHandler` parameter. In certain cases, such as reported in #1095, Alamofire was not providing enough flexibility to allow a user to override the implementation and perform some async operation before calling the `completionHandler`. These changes allow users to fully override the entire set of functionality inside any of the `SessionDelegate` APIs.\n\n> For more details about a specific use case, please refer to #1095.\n\nAn alternative approach to this PR would be to remove the `final` modifier from the `SessionDelegate` declaration. This would allow users to subclass the `SessionDelegate` which would remove the need for these variant closures. I feel though that this is not a good idea since the `SessionDelegate` does not publicly expose the subdelegates and opening this up could lead to misuse when subclassing.\n\ncc @jshier, @kcharwood, @kylef, @AnthonyMDev \n",

      "body": "This PR removes the `final` keyword from the `SessionManager` declaration. These changes allow advanced users to subclass the `SessionDelegate`, but should only be used when absolutely necessary. A simple example of such a use case would be to use a proxy pattern to emit notifications or log messages when certain APIs are called. The override closures do not allow you to do this and still use the default implementation.\n\nI also added a section to the README detailing the different ways to use the override closures vs. subclassing. Hopefully this provides enough info to allow users to make the best decision for their use case.\n",

      "body": "The goal of this PR is to refactor ALL APIs used in the framework and test target source code to align with the Swift 3 API design guidelines. \n\nThe codebase has also been reorganized to make it easier to subclass the `SessionManager`, `SessionDelegate` and `Request` by eliminating excessive use of extensions by splitting core functionality up by feature.\n\nThe new top-level APIs now can be used as follows:\n\n``` swift\n// Data Requests\nAlamofire.request(\"https://httpbin.org/get\", withMethod: .get, parameters: [\"foo\": \"bar\"])\nAlamofire.request(urlRequest)\n\n// Download Requests\nAlamofire.download(\"https://httpbin.org/get\", to: destination, withMethod: .get)\nAlamofire.download(urlRequest, to: destination)\nAlamofire.download(resourceWithin: resumeData, to: destination)\n\n// Upload Requests\nAlamofire.upload(imageURL, to: \"https://httpbin.org/\", withMethod: .post, headers: headers)\nAlamofire.upload(data, to: urlString, withMethod: .post, headers: headers)\nAlamofire.upload(imageStream, to: urlString, withMethod: .post)\n\nAlamofire.upload(\n    multipartFormData: { multipartFormData in\n        multipartFormData.append(uploadData, withName: \"upload_data\")\n        formData = multipartFormData\n    },\n    to: urlString,\n    withMethod: .post,\n    encodingCompletion: { result in\n        switch result {\n        case .success(let upload, _, _):\n            upload.responseJSON { response in\n                debugPrint(response)\n            }\n        case .failure:\n            debugPrint(result)\n        }\n    }\n)\n```\n\nThere are also several refactored classes, structs and enums including:\n- `Method` is now `HTTPMethod` in ParameterEncoding.swift\n- `Manager` is now `SessionManager` in SessionManager.swift\n- `Manager.sharedInstance` is now `SessionManager.default` in SessionManager.swift\n- `Manager.SessionDelegate` is now `SessionDelegate` in SessionDelegate.swift\n- `Request.TaskDelegate` is now `TaskDelegate` in TaskDelegate.swift\n- `Request.DataTaskDelegate` is now `DataTaskDelegate in TaskDelegate.swift\n- `Request.DownloadTaskDelegate` is now `DownloadTaskDelegate in TaskDelegate.swift\n- `Request.UploadTaskDelegate` is now `UploadTaskDelegate` in TaskDelegate.swift\n\nI've also updates all the public docstrings to use the new Swift 3 formatting syntax. I fixed several issues within the documentation and updated them to all match the new APIs.\n\n> The diff here is absolutely horrendous. I would suggest anyone looking to review this pull the branch and look at the changes directly in Xcode.\n",

      "body": "This PR adds a couple powerful protocols, `RequestAdapter` and `RequestRetrier`, that open up all sorts of possibilities including:\n- Easing `Request` modifications for `Authorization` headers\n- Retrying requests that encountered an error with a custom exponential backoff retry policy\n- Completely thread-safe refresh systems for web services behind OAuth2 authentication\n\nI'm sure there are all sorts of other cool things you could do with this, but these are the main things I had in mind when putting this together.\n## RequestAdapter\n\nThe `RequestAdapter` protocol allows each `Request` made on a `SessionManager` to be inspected and adapted before being created. One very specific way to use an adapter is to append an `Authorization` header to requests behind a certain type of authentication.\n\n``` swift\nclass AccessTokenAdapter: RequestAdapter {\n    private let accessToken: String\n\n    init(accessToken: String) {\n        self.accessToken = accessToken\n    }\n\n    func adapt(_ urlRequest: URLRequest) -> URLRequest {\n        var urlRequest = urlRequest\n\n        if urlRequest.urlString.hasPrefix(\"https://httpbin.org\") {\n            urlRequest.setValue(\"Bearer \" + accessToken, forHTTPHeaderField: \"Authorization\")\n        }\n\n        return urlRequest\n    }\n}\n\nlet sessionManager = SessionManager()\nsessionManager.adapter = AccessTokenAdapter(accessToken: \"1234\")\n\nsessionManager.request(\"https://httpbin.org/get\", withMethod: .get)\n```\n## RequestRetrier\n\nThe `RequestRetrier` protocol allows a `Request` that encountered an `Error` while being executed to be retried. When using both the `RequestAdapter` and `RequestRetrier` protocols together, you can create credential refresh systems for OAuth1, OAuth2, Basic Auth and even exponential backoff retry policies. The possibilities are endless. Here's a short example of how you could implement a refresh flow for OAuth2 access tokens.\n\n``` swift\nclass OAuth2Handler: RequestAdapter, RequestRetrier {\n    private typealias RefreshCompletion = (_ succeeded: Bool, _ accessToken: String?, _ refreshToken: String?) -> Void\n\n    private let sessionManager: SessionManager = {\n        let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.default\n        configuration.httpAdditionalHeaders = SessionManager.defaultHTTPHeaders\n\n        return SessionManager(configuration: configuration)\n    }()\n\n    private let lock = NSLock()\n\n    private var clientID: String\n    private var baseURLString: String\n    private var accessToken: String\n    private var refreshToken: String\n\n    private var isRefreshing = false\n    private var requestsToRetry: [RequestRetryCompletion] = []\n\n    // MARK: - Initialization\n\n    public init(clientID: String, baseURLString: String, accessToken: String, refreshToken: String) {\n        self.clientID = clientID\n        self.baseURLString = baseURLString\n        self.accessToken = accessToken\n        self.refreshToken = refreshToken\n    }\n\n    // MARK: - RequestAdapter\n\n    public func adapt(_ urlRequest: URLRequest) -> URLRequest {\n        if urlRequest.urlString.hasPrefix(baseURLString) {\n            var mutableURLRequest = urlRequest\n            mutableURLRequest.setValue(\"Bearer \" + accessToken, forHTTPHeaderField: \"Authorization\")\n            return mutableURLRequest\n        }\n\n        return urlRequest\n    }\n\n    // MARK: - RequestRetrier\n\n    public func should(_ manager: SessionManager, retry request: Request, with error: Error, completion: RequestRetryCompletion) {\n        lock.lock() ; defer { lock.unlock() }\n\n        if let response = request.task.response as? HTTPURLResponse, response.statusCode == 401 {\n            requestsToRetry.append(completion)\n\n            if !isRefreshing {\n                refreshTokens { [weak self] succeeded, accessToken, refreshToken in\n                    guard let strongSelf = self else { return }\n\n                    strongSelf.lock.lock() ; defer { strongSelf.lock.unlock() }\n\n                    if let accessToken = accessToken, let refreshToken = refreshToken {\n                        strongSelf.accessToken = accessToken\n                        strongSelf.refreshToken = refreshToken\n                    }\n\n                    strongSelf.requestsToRetry.forEach { $0(succeeded, 0.0) }\n                    strongSelf.requestsToRetry.removeAll()\n                }\n            }\n        } else {\n            completion(false, 0.0)\n        }\n    }\n\n    // MARK: - Private - Refresh Tokens\n\n    private func refreshTokens(completion: RefreshCompletion) {\n        guard !isRefreshing else { return }\n\n        isRefreshing = true\n\n        let urlString = \"\\(baseURLString)/oauth2/token\"\n\n        let parameters: [String: Any] = [\n            \"access_token\": accessToken,\n            \"refresh_token\": refreshToken,\n            \"client_id\": clientID,\n            \"grant_type\": \"refresh_token\"\n        ]\n\n        sessionManager.request(urlString, withMethod: .post, parameters: parameters, encoding: .json).responseJSON { [weak self] response in\n            guard let strongSelf = self else { return }\n\n            if let json = response.result.value as? [String: String] {\n                completion(true, json[\"access_token\"], json[\"refresh_token\"])\n            } else {\n                completion(false, nil, nil)\n            }\n\n            strongSelf.isRefreshing = false\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet baseURLString = \"https://some.domain-behind-oauth2.com\"\n\nlet oauthHandler = OAuth2Handler(\n    clientID: \"12345678\",\n    baseURLString: baseURLString,\n    accessToken: \"abcd1234\",\n    refreshToken: \"ef56789a\"\n)\n\nlet sessionManager = SessionManager()\nsessionManager.adapter = oauthHandler\nsessionManager.retrier = oauthHandler\n\nlet urlString = \"\\(baseURLString)/some/endpoint\"\n\nmanager.request(urlString, withMethod: .get).validate().responseJSON { response in\n    debugPrint(response)\n}\n```\n\n---\n## Tests\n\nI've added tests around the `RequestAdapter` to make sure all the `SessionManager` APIs actually  call the `adapter` if set. I also added tests verifying the `retrier` is called when errors occur and that the `adapter` will be called again when the request is retried.\n## Internal Modifications\n\nThere are several internal changes that are worth calling out to make this work.\n### Validations\n\nThe first is that `Validation` is no longer run on the delegate's `OperationQueue`. In order to determine whether a `Request` encountered an error, we need to make sure we run all the validations first, otherwise the error won't be set and the `retrier` won't be called. This was a trivial change to implement, but is an important callout.\n### TaskConvertible\n\nThe `TaskConvertible` enum nested in the `Request` class allows us to store the un-adapted version of the `Request` before it is adapted and turned into a `URLSessionTask`. The `retry` method on the `SessionManager` uses the new `originalTask` property to extract the original urlRequest, adapt it if necessary, then create the new task and apply it to the `Request`. By setting a new task on the `TaskDelegate`, it automatically resets all the data tracked in the `TaskDelegate` as though it is a brand new task.\n### SessionDelegate\n\nThe `SessionManager` must be passed down to the `SessionDelegate` as a `weak` property in order to allow the `SessionManager` to retry the `Request` from the `SessionDelegate`. I originally had the retry logic in the `Request` class, but it became problematic when trying to figure out how to lock down the task creation on the `SessionManager` queue. While I don't love having to store the parent reference in the child, it's not so bad since it's not exposed publicly and it doesn't result in a retain cycle since it's a `weak` reference. \n\n> I'm very open to suggestions here on a better approach, but I think this is about the cleanest way to do it.\n## README Updates\n\nI've added a `Adapting and Retrying Requests` section to the README to walk users through some of the ways you could use these protocols. I also created a fairly detailed `OAuth2` example to demonstrate how to start to build a thread-safe refresh system that could be shared across multiple session managers.\n\n---\n## Summary\n\nOverall I think these are two very powerful protocols that will open up all sorts of possibilities for the Alamofire community. I'd love to see custom `RequestRetrier` implementations for linear and exponential back-off policies for things like background sync operations. Can't wait to see what everyone comes up with!\n",

      "body": "This PR splits up the `Request` class into `DataRequest`, `DownloadRequest`, `UploadRequest` and `StreamRequest` subclasses.\n## Motivation\n\nThere were several reasons why the `Request` class could greatly benefit from being split up. \n### Progress\n\nThe first reason is that the progress APIs were stomping on each other and were confusing the users. For example, the upload progress behavior was very ambiguous considering that the same `Progress` instance was used to report both upload progress and then download progress after the upload was complete.\n### Session Manager Duplication\n\nThe `feature/adapter-and-retrier` PR added the `TaskConvertible` enumeration to the `Request` class. Unfortunately, there is a large amount of duplication between the `TaskConvertible` implementation and the `Downloadable`, `Uploadable` and `Streamable` enumerations inside the `SessionManager`. Not only is there duplication, but the `Downloadable`, `Uploadable` and `Streamable` enumerations don't really belong in the `SessionManager` anyways. They're really the pieces required to construct a concrete `Request`.\n\nBy splitting up the `Request` into subclasses, we could move the `Downloadable`, `Uploadable` and `Streamable` implementations into their respective subclass and eliminate the duplication with the `TaskConvertible` enumeration in the `Request` class.\n\nIn the previous PR where the `TaskConvertible` enumeration was added, the `Downloadable`, `Uploadable` and `Streamable` enumerations\n### Response Serializers\n\nAnother awesome reason for splitting up the `Request` class is to associate response serializers with a particular request type. For example, right now you can chain a `responseData` closure onto a `Request` that is backed by a `URLSessionDownloadTask` or a `ULRSessionStreamTask`. However, if you do this, what's the behavior? It currently gets really weird in all these cases when you start to consider resume data. \n\nAlso, how does one get the destination URL of a download? Great question, right now it is WAY more difficult than it should be. By splitting up the `Request`, we can extend only certain subclasses to support specific response serializers that are tailored to the underlying type of task. These changes will be coming in a future PR.\n## Solution\n\nSo now that we have some background as to why these changes would be useful, let's dig into what had to change to make this work.\n### TaskConvertible\n\nBy pulling the `Downloadable`, `Uploadable` and `Streamable` enumerations into their respective subclasses and adding a `Requestable` enumeration to the `DataRequest` subclass, I was able to get rid of the `TaskConvertible` enumeration and make it a protocol. The protocol now creates a `URLSessionTask` from a session, adapter and queue. This allows the subclassed enumerations to construct the tasks directly without having to do this in the `SessionManager`. This greatly simplifies the `SessionManager.retry` method.\n### Progress\n\nThe progress APIs have been completely rebuilt from scratch. You can now monitor `downloadProgress` on data, download and upload requests. You can also monitor `uploadProgress` on an upload request. There are variants for both the `Progress` object and the broken out `Int64` values. Each variant can also call the progress closure on a specified queue.\n\nHere's a quick example of how you can use the new APIs.\n\n``` swift\nAlamofire.upload(data, to: urlString, withMethod: .post)\n    .uploadProgress { progress in\n        // Called on main dispatch queue by default\n        print(\"upload progress: \\(progress.fractionCompleted)\")\n    }\n    .uploadProgress(queue: DispatchQueue.utility) { bytesSent, totalBytesSent, totalBytesExpectedToSend in\n        // Can customize the dispatch queue for background operations if needed\n        print(\"Sent: \\(bytesSent), Total Sent: \\(totalBytesSent), Total Expected: \\(totalBytesExpectedToSend)\")\n    }\n    .downloadProgress { progress in\n        // Called on main dispatch queue by default\n        print(\"download progress: \\(progress.fractionCompleted)\")\n    }\n    .downloadProgress { bytesRead, totalBytesRead, totalBytesExpectedToRead in\n        // Called on main dispatch queue by default\n        print(\"Read: \\(bytesRead), Total Read: \\(totalBytesRead), Total Expected: \\(totalBytesExpectedToRead)\")\n    }\n    .response { response in\n        debugPrint(response)\n    }\n```\n#### Download Progress\n\nThe download progress is now being tracked in the `DataTaskDelegate`. This allows the data, download and upload requests to leverage it. I debated for a long time as to whether to call this `progress` or `downloadProgress`. I would rather error on the side of verbosity here I think. I ultimately decided upon `downloadProgress` because `progress` is REALLY ambiguous when it comes to an upload request.\n\n> If anyone strongly disagrees here, please voice your concerns. I'm still on the fence on this one, but right now lean towards `downloadProgress` and `uploadProgress` APIs to completely avoid ambiguity.\n#### Upload Progress\n\nThe upload progress is all managed by the `UploadTaskDelegate` and is only exposed publicly through the upload request subclass. The stream request cannot chain `downloadProgress` or `uploadProgress` APIs because it no longer inherits them.\n### Top-Level Stream APIs\n\nI added the top-level stream APIs to `Alamofire.swift` because they were missing. Just wanted to callout that this random change made its way into this PR as well.\n\n---\n## Summary\n\nThese changes vastly improve the `progress` APIs and open up the ability to greatly specialize the available chained methods for each subclass. This will help avoid confusion and will allow for better customization for each request type.\n",

      "body": "This PR locks current response serializers down to data and upload requests and creates all new response serializers for download requests.\n## Motivation\n\nPrior to this PR, response serializers could be applied to any `Request` subclass. This works great for data and upload requests, but completely falls apart for download and stream requests. Response serializers should only be able to be chained onto `Request` subclasses that match the actual serializer behavior.\n## Solution\n\nIn order to achieve this, I had to create a few new types:\n- `DefaultDataResponse` - Encapsulates all data associated with an unserialized data or upload request\n- `DataResponse` - Encapsulates all data associated with a serialized data or upload request\n- `DefaultDownloadResponse` - Encapsulates all data associated with an unserialized download request\n- `DownloadResponse` - Encapsulates all data associated with a serialized download request\n- `DataResponseSerializerType` - data response serialization protocol\n- `DataResponseSerializer` - generic data response serializer\n- `DownloadResponseSerializerType` - download response serialization protocol\n- `DownloadResponseSerializer` - generic download response serializer\n### Default Responses\n\nThe `DefaultDataResponse` and `DefaultDownloadResponse` structs were created to make the unserialized forms of the `response` APIs consistent with the serialized versions in only returning a single `response` parameter. The consistency is a nice addition.\n### Data and Download Response Serializers\n\nIt would have been possible to add support to the `ResponseSerializer` and `Response` types for download requests, but it would not have been an ideal set of changes. First off, the chainable `Request` APIs would still be available to the `StreamRequest`. Also, the `Response` struct would have picked up `destinationURL` and `resumeData` properties which would only be set when serializing a `DownloadRequest`. Because of these reasons, I thought it best to make a clean split between them and tailor each set of APIs to their respective subclass.\n### Request Serialization Extensions\n\nWhen I first built out the variants between data and download response serializers, I realized there was a lot of code duplication when running all the different validation scenarios. The only real difference between them was that the download response serializer first needed to extract the data out of the `destinationURL`. Once that was done, the rest of the validation was the same between them.\n\nBecause of this, I pulled the common logic out into extensions on `Request` to be shared between both the `DataRequest` and `DownloadRequest` extension implementations. Here's an example of the String serialization.\n\n``` swift\nextension Request {\n    public static func serializeResponseString(\n        encoding: String.Encoding?,\n        response: HTTPURLResponse?,\n        data: Data?,\n        error: Error?)\n        -> Result<String>\n    {\n        guard error == nil else { return .failure(error!) }\n\n        if let response = response, emptyDataStatusCodes.contains(response.statusCode) { return .success(\"\") }\n\n        guard let validData = data else {\n            return .failure(AFError.responseSerializationFailed(reason: .inputDataNil))\n        }\n\n        var convertedEncoding = encoding\n\n        if let encodingName = response?.textEncodingName as CFString!, convertedEncoding == nil {\n            convertedEncoding = String.Encoding(rawValue: CFStringConvertEncodingToNSStringEncoding(\n                CFStringConvertIANACharSetNameToEncoding(encodingName))\n            )\n        }\n\n        let actualEncoding = convertedEncoding ?? String.Encoding.isoLatin1\n\n        if let string = String(data: validData, encoding: actualEncoding) {\n            return .success(string)\n        } else {\n            return .failure(AFError.responseSerializationFailed(reason: .stringSerializationFailed(encoding: actualEncoding)))\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nextension DataRequest {\n    public static func stringResponseSerializer(encoding: String.Encoding? = nil) -> DataResponseSerializer<String> {\n        return DataResponseSerializer { _, response, data, error in\n            return Request.serializeResponseString(encoding: encoding, response: response, data: data, error: error)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nextension DownloadRequest {\n    public static func stringResponseSerializer(encoding: String.Encoding? = nil) -> DownloadResponseSerializer<String> {\n        return DownloadResponseSerializer { _, response, fileURL, error in\n            guard error == nil else { return .failure(error!) }\n\n            guard let fileURL = fileURL else {\n                return .failure(AFError.responseSerializationFailed(reason: .inputFileNil))\n            }\n\n            do {\n                let data = try Data(contentsOf: fileURL)\n                return Request.serializeResponseString(encoding: encoding, response: response, data: data, error: error)\n            } catch {\n                return .failure(AFError.responseSerializationFailed(reason: .inputFileReadFailed(at: fileURL)))\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, almost all the string validation takes place in the shared `Request. serializeResponseString` method. I used this same pattern across all the response serializers to DRY it up significantly.\n## Common Usage\n\nNow that we have download request response serializers, you can actually download a json blob to a file and still use a `responseJSON` serializer to extract the data. No more trying to figure out what the heck the `destinationURL` actually is!\n\n``` swift\nlet fileURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: FileManager.documentsDirectory + \"/get.json\")\nlet destination: DownloadRequest.DownloadFileDestination = { _, _ in fileURL }\n\nAlamofire.download(\"https://httpbin.org/get\", to: destination, withMethod: .get).responseJSON { response in\n    debugPrint(response)\n}\n```\n\n---\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, these changes should fix up all sorts of confusing problems people have had with response serializers in the past. The don't make creating your own custom serializers any easier, but I don't think they make it any harder either. They now just add the ability to make custom ones for in-memory downloads or on-disk downloads.\n",

      },
      "body": "This PR splits up validation between `Request` subclasses and adds `Data?` or `URL?` parameters to the `Validation` closure.\n## Motivation\n\nPreviously, the Validation closure only exposed the optional request and response parameters making it difficult to customize validations in inline closures that were not custom extensions in the `Request` class. You didn’t have access to the actual response data. This was limiting in certain cases where you want to create a custom validation error that includes the error message buried in the server data. The only way you could do this previously was to write an extension on `Request`.\n\nAnother limitation was that the `Validation` closure did not expose the `destinationURL` for a `DownloadRequest` incase you needed to inspect the data in some special scenario.\n\nOne final reason to change up the design was that all `validate` methods could be chained on any `Request`. This doesn't make sense for `StreamRequest` types.\n## Solution\n\nModifying the validation system to accomplish all the goals stated above meant rethinking the majority of the design and splitting it up between subclasses.\n### Data Request\n\nThe `Validation` closure exposed on the `DataRequest` class is now as follows:\n\n``` swift\nextension DataRequest {\n    public typealias Validation = (URLRequest?, HTTPURLResponse, Data?) -> ValidationResult\n}\n```\n\nBy exposing the `Data?` property directly in the closure, you no longer have to write an extension on `Request` to access it. Now you can do something like this:\n\n``` swift\nlet urlString = \"https://httpbin.org/get\"\n\n// When\nAlamofire.request(\"https://httpbin.org/get\", withMethod: .get)\n    .validate { request, response, data in\n        guard data != nil else { return .failure(ValidationError.missingData) }\n        return .success\n    }\n    .response { response in\n        debugPrint(response)\n    }\n```\n\n> This will be helpful in those cases where you would like to create a custom error that includes the error message from the server that's buried in the `data`.\n### Download Request\n\nThe `Validation` closure exposed on the `DownloadRequest` class is now as follows:\n\n``` swift\nextension DownloadRequest {\n    public typealias Validation = (URLRequest?, HTTPURLResponse, URL?) -> ValidationResult\n}\n```\n\nThe `URL?` parameter allows you to access the response data downloaded from the server and stored in the `destinationURL`. This allows you to inspect the data inside the file if you've determined you need to in order to create a custom error.\n\n``` swift\nlet fileURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: FileManager.documentsDirectory + \"/test_response.json\")\n\nAlamofire.download(urlString, to: { _, _ in fileURL }, withMethod: .get)\n    .validate { request, response, fileURL in\n        guard let fileURL = fileURL else { return .failure(ValidationError.missingFile) }\n\n        do {\n            let _ = try Data(contentsOf: fileURL)\n            return .success\n        } catch {\n            return .failure(ValidationError.fileReadFailed)\n        }\n    }\n    .response { response in\n        debugPrint(response)\n    }\n```\n### DRY by Design\n\nSince the default validation methods supported in AF are the same between data and download requests, I decided to DRY things up by pulling the validation logic out into a `fileprivate` set of extensions on `Request`. This is very similar to how the response serialization logic was DRY'd up as well.\n## Session Manager\n\nI also snuck in commit c46bc01f into this PR that updates the `SessionManager` to leverage the new `TaskConvertible` conformance to generate the `URLSessionTask` instances. This cleans up a bunch of duplicated logic that I should have caught in the earlier PRs. This commit doesn't change any functionality, just DRYs things up a bit.\n\n---\n## Summary\n\nThese changes allow inline validation closures to be much more powerful, eliminates chaining validation APIs on `StreamRequest` instances, and exposes the `destinationURL` directly to the inline closure. We'll want to update the Validation section of the README to include examples of best practices here.\n\n> We need to make sure people understand they shouldn't parse the response data unless they know they're in a failure case where they want to dig the error message out.\n",

      "body": "This PR refactors the download destination system as well as the top-level APIs for constructing requests.\n## Motivation\n\nUp until now, the `DownloadFileDestination` closures have been too limiting. They \"force\" you to move the file from the temporary URL to some other URL. Even if you don't want to move it, you still have to implement a destination closure and return the temp URL.\n\nA bigger issue is that you have to do all your preparation of the file system up front. You cannot modify the file system at the time the destination closure is called. For example, let's say I have an avatar image at `$Sandbox/Documents/avatar.jpg` and I want to update it. Right now, you have to either delete the `avatar.jpg` file before making the request or move it to a different location. Otherwise you'll get a file system error when trying to move the file because a file already exists at the destination url. But you don't want to delete it before you make the request because you don't know that the request will actually succeed.\n\nOn a different note, we've wanted to remove the `with` portion of the `withMethod` external parameter name in the top-level APIs. We've also wanted to figure out how add default values for the method without introducing ambiguity.\n## Solution\n### Download File Destination Closure\n\nThe first major change in this PR is to make the `destination` closure optional in all the top-level APIs. You no longer have to move the file if you don't want to. It's now perfectly acceptable to do the following:\n\n``` swift\nAlamofire.download(\"https://httpbin.org/get\").responseJSON { response in\n    debugPrint(response)\n}\n```\n\nIf you do this, the file will stay in the temporary location. If you want to move it somewhere else, you'll need to handle that on your own.\n\n> It's important to note that you should always move the file out of the temporary location if you are going to need access to it at a later time.\n\nNow if you do want to move the file to a different destination, you'll need to use the `DownloadFileDestination` closure which is a bit different.\n\n``` swift\npublic typealias DownloadFileDestination = (\n    _ temporaryURL: URL,\n    _ response: HTTPURLResponse)\n    -> (destinationURL: URL, options: DownloadOptions)\n```\n\nYou'll notice that the typealias is the same as it was before with the exception of the `DownloadOptions` in the return type.\n### Download Options\n\nThe `DownloadOptions` struct is an `OptionSet` that comes with a couple cool new features.\n- `.createIntermediateDirectories` - creates all intermediate directories to the destination url if specified\n- `.removePreviousFile` - removes a previous file at the destination url if it exists right before moving the temp file to the destination url\n\nThese options allow you to customize the file system behavior right before the temp file is moved to the final destination url. Here's an example of what it looks like to use the new destination closure system.\n\n``` swift\nlet destination: DownloadRequest.DownloadFileDestination = { _, _ in \n    return (fileURL, [.removePreviousFile, .createIntermediateDirectories]) \n}\n\nAlamofire.download(urlString, to: destination).response { response in\n    debugPrint(response)\n}\n```\n### DownloadResponse\n\nThe `DownloadResponse` has been modified to support both the `temporaryURL` and `destinationURL` properties. The `temporaryURL` will always be set if the file was successfully downloaded. The `destinationURL` will be set if the file was successfully downloaded and the `destination` closure was set. Make sure to check whether the `Result` was a success though to know the file was able to be copied to the `destinationURL`. If the move operation fails, an error is generated, but `destinationURL` is not `nil`. I designed it this way so that when an error occurs, you have as much information as possible to debug what happened.\n### Download Request Validation\n\nThe `Validation` typealias for a `DownloadRequest` has been modified to support both the `temporaryURL` and `destinationURL`.\n\n``` swift\npublic typealias Validation = (URLRequest?, HTTPURLResponse, _ temporary: URL?, _ destination: URL?) -> ValidationResult\n```\n### Top-Level APIs\n\nThe goal of the top-level API changes was to set `method` defaults and get rid of the `with` portion of the `withMethod` external parameter name. The results are pretty awesome. You can now do the following:\n\n``` swift\nAlamofire.request(\"https://httpbin.org/get\") // defaults to `.get`\nAlamofire.download(\"https://httpbin.org/get\") // defaults to `.get`\nAlamofire.upload(\"https://httpbin.org/post\") // defaults to `.post`\n```\n\nSince this is certainly the majority of the use cases, this makes the call sights much more concise. If you do need to specify the `method`, it's now just `method` instead of `withMethod`.\n\n``` swift\nAlamofire.request(\"https://httpbin.org/delete\", method: .delete)\n```\n\nIn order to disambiguate the `request` APIs, we had to add the external `resource` parameter name to the `URLRequestConvertible` variant.\n\n``` swift\nAlamofire.request(resource: urlRequest)\nAlamofire.download(resource: urlRequest, to: destination)\n```\n\nThe reason for this is that `URLRequest` conforms to both `URLStringConvertible` and `URLRequestConvertible`. Rather than going down the route of removing conforms, I decided to just remove the potential of ambiguity altogether. Otherwise users could add their own extensions to types that would re-introduce ambiguity. And as well all know, ambiguous errors suck to debug.\n\nOne thing that I think is still open is whether we add the `resource` name to the upload APIs.\n\n``` swift\n// Current\nAlamofire.upload(fileURL, to: urlString)\nAlamofire.upload(fileURL, with: urlRequest)\n\n// Possible Improvements\nAlamofire.upload(fileURL, to: urlRequest)\nAlamofire.upload(fileURL, toResource: urlRequest)\n```\n\nThoughts here?\n\n---\n## Summary\n\nThese changes greatly improve the functionality and usefulness of download requests by allowing them to support all the potential use cases. In the event that the `DownloadOptions` don't offer you enough flexibility, you can alway fall back to moving the file on your own in the response serializer. The top-level API changes are a huge improvement and make the common usage cases very concise.\n",

      },
      "body": "This PR is an alternative to #1464 that goes WAY further in refactoring the `ParameterEncoding` logic into a protocol instead of an enumeration.\n## Motivation\n\nThe `ParameterEncoding` enum hasn't been flexible enough to allow us to customize the behavior of a particular encoding type. For example, we had to introduce the new `.urlEncodedInURL` case just to allow users to be able to force the parameters into the query string when their backends required them to do so on a `POST` or `PUT`.\n\nThe enum also doesn't allow us to open up different writing options for the JSON and plist serializers. We can't customize plist formats, etc. The list goes on and on since we're locked to the enum that can't add extra cases or associated values in a backwards compatible manner.\n## Solution\n\nGet rid of the enumeration altogether! Now the `ParameterEncoding` type of a protocol backed by concrete `URL`, `JSON` and `PropertyList` conforming structs.\n\n``` swift\npublic typealias Parameters = [String: Any]\n\npublic protocol ParameterEncoding {\n    func encode(_ urlRequest: URLRequestConvertible, with parameters: Parameters?) throws -> URLRequest\n}\n```\n\nIt was amazing after I split everything up how much sense it really makes. `ParameterEncoding` implementations are now free of the enumeration bounds and are free to customize to their own needs. \n### URLEncoding\n\nThe `.url` and `.urlEncodedInURL` cases have now been combined in the `URLEncoding` struct with some new enumerations and properties of it's own.\n\n``` swift\npublic struct URLEncoding: ParameterEncoding {\n    public enum Destination {\n        case methodDependent, queryString, httpBody\n    }\n\n    public static var `default`: URLEncoding { return URLEncoding() }\n    public static var methodDependent: URLEncoding { return URLEncoding() }\n    public static var queryString: URLEncoding { return URLEncoding(destination: .queryString) }\n    public static var httpBody: URLEncoding { return URLEncoding(destination: .httpBody) }\n\n    public let destination: Destination\n\n    public init(destination: Destination = .methodDependent) {\n        self.destination = destination\n    }\n\n    public func encode(_ urlRequest: URLRequestConvertible, with parameters: Parameters?) throws -> URLRequest {\n        // left out for simplicity\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI added convenience properties for accessing instances without having to go through the initializer. This was a nice touch. We could actually hide the initializer if we wanted, but I figured that was a step too far.\n### JSONEncoding\n\nThe `JSONEncoding` struct is much less complicated than the `URLEncoding` struct for obvious reasons.\n\n> It's simpler!\n\n``` swift\npublic struct JSONEncoding: ParameterEncoding {\n    public static var `default`: JSONEncoding { return JSONEncoding() }\n    public static var prettyPrinted: JSONEncoding { return JSONEncoding(options: .prettyPrinted) }\n\n    public let options: JSONSerialization.WritingOptions\n\n    public init(options: JSONSerialization.WritingOptions = []) {\n        self.options = options\n    }\n\n    public func encode(_ urlRequest: URLRequestConvertible, with parameters: Parameters?) throws -> URLRequest {\n        // left out for simplicity\n    }\n}\n```\n### PropertyListEncoding\n\nThe `PropertyListEncoding` struct is very similar to the `JSONEncoding` struct, just with a few more properties.\n\n``` swift\npublic struct PropertyListEncoding: ParameterEncoding {\n    public static var `default`: PropertyListEncoding { return PropertyListEncoding() }\n    public static var xml: PropertyListEncoding { return PropertyListEncoding(format: .xml) }\n    public static var binary: PropertyListEncoding { return PropertyListEncoding(format: .binary) }\n\n    public let format: PropertyListSerialization.PropertyListFormat\n    public let options: PropertyListSerialization.WriteOptions\n\n    public init(\n        format: PropertyListSerialization.PropertyListFormat = .xml,\n        options: PropertyListSerialization.WriteOptions = 0)\n    {\n        self.format = format\n        self.options = options\n    }\n\n    public func encode(_ urlRequest: URLRequestConvertible, with parameters: Parameters?) throws -> URLRequest {\n        // left out for simplicity\n    }\n}\n```\n\n> If you noticed `default` and `xml` are exact duplicate properties, bonus points for you. I wanted to follow the same `.default` property convention across all the `ParameterEncoding` types for consistency. That way at the call sight you can always use `<encoding_struct>.default` and know it will be there. _I wonder if that should be enforced in the protocol_ 🤔\n### Wrapping Up Parameters with Encoding\n\nSo I tried for probably 2 hours to work the parameters and the encoding into a single type. I had `Parameters` as the protocol and `URLParameters`, `JSONParameters`, etc. and you'd create the object like `URLParameters(parameters)` and call it like so:\n\n``` swift\nAlamofire.request(urlString, parameters: URLParameters(parameters)\n```\n\nPart of this was great because it got rid of the `encoding` parameter altogether which I was all for. However, it greatly increased the majority of our calls because it can't rely on the default parameter value of `.url` anymore. So we end up having to write `URLParameters(parameters)` everywhere instead of just `parameters`. Not to mention it just feels a little off.\n\nBecause of all of this, I finally decided enough was enough and it was just a square peg, round hole scenario. Once I backed away, I was able to finally land on the solution you see here.\n### Throwing vs. Double Tuple\n\nThis also includes all the changes to the `encode` method itself which was part of the previous PR. These changes should definitely be adopted in AF 4. It's time to eliminate the last odd double optional case we have left! 🙌🏼🏆\n\n---\n## Summary\n\nOverall, I think this is an awesome set of changes for AF 4. It makes it so much easier to create your own custom `ParameterEncoding` type. It also rids the world of the `.urlEncodedInURL` case that I sadly had to introduce a year ago.\n",

We don't actually use it for anything anymore and it's misleading and problematic. I actually almost removed it before but didn't have a strong reason to because I hadn't realized what @tremblay did.\n",

      "body": "This PR adds support for the awesome new `URLSessionTaskMetric` statistical tracking. This is essentially what we always wanted the `Timeline` to be, but we didn't have access to the same internal APIs to compute all these data points. Thanks Apple!\n\n> For the time being, it makes sense to keep the `Timeline` around for watchOS and earlier versions of the platforms that don't support the new APIs.\n\nThis shouldn't be a difficult feature to build, but it most definitely was due to the complexity of compiling against 4 platforms with only three of the latest actually supporting new APIs. Therefore, I had to get pretty creative with the new `Response` protocol and extension in combination with `AnyObject` abstraction while moving the metrics through the various objects.\n\nOverall, I'm VERY happy with how this turned out. I wish it wasn't so complicated to support so many platforms, but unfortunately, it is. I abstracted the complexity away into the single `Response` protocol and implementation, so that certainly helps isolate all the platform complexity to a single area.\n",

      "body": "This PR simply put makes Alamofire safe. Invalid URL strings, parameter encoding errors, adaptation errors, etc. are now all allowed to be used and thrown and Alamofire will gracefully handle it and expose the error in the response handlers.\n## Motivation\n\nA VERY common problem in Alamofire is that users forget to percent escape their URL strings and Alamofire will crash. Up until now, we (the Alamofire team) have taken the stance that this is how Alamofire is designed and your URLs need to conform to [RFC 2396](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2396). This is certainly not ideal for the community because we all would rather have Alamofire tell us that our URL was invalid rather than having it crash.\n## Solution\n\nIn order to make this safe, there were several things that needed to change including:\n- Making the `task` optional on a `Request`\n- Allowing the `URLStringConvertible` protocol to throw\n- Allowing the `URLRequestConvertible` protocol to throw\n- Allowing the `RequestAdapter` protocol to throw\n- Modifying all the `SessionManager` request creation methods to handle all error propagation\n\nThe core change here was making the `task` optional. By not requiring a `URLSessionTask` to actually be created and added to the underlying `URLSession`, we freed ourselves from the burden of trying to figure out what to do instead...which was always CRASH, or possibly even worse, send the `URLRequest` off even though we know it was wrong.\n\nOnce we made the task optional, I started allowing the protocols involved to be able to throw errors as well. We'd already made the change a few days ago to allow `ParameterEncoding` to throw which was a great change. But previously if it threw, we would record the error on the `Request`, but we would still have to send off the original `URLRequest` (missing the parameter encoding) because Alamofire required us to. You would receive the error in the response handler (good), but the request you intended to send to the server is not actually what got sent (very very bad).\n\nNow, all these problem have been alleviated. If any of the steps encounter an error, Alamofire stops the task creation process, builds the `Request` subclass without the `task`, then starts up the delegate queue when `resume` is called. The response handlers will have access to the original error, and no task was ever sent out since we knew we couldn't create the one you wanted.\n### Remaining Tasks\n\nThere are still some documentation updates that need to be added to this PR before we move it through. They include:\n- [x] Update README with all API changes\n- [x] Update `URLStringConvertible` section of migration guide\n- [x] Add `URLRequestConvertible` section to migration guide\n- [x] Update `RequestAdapter` section of migration guide\n\n---\n## Summary\n\nOf all the great changes going into Alamofire 4, I think this one is probably the best. Alamofire 3.x is simply not safe if you don't make sure every request going through it is set up properly. Now most of the community has adjusted to this stance, but it's all to simple to miss a single case and have it end up crashing your app in production.\n\nNo more with Alamofire 4. Invalid requests simply go through Alamofire and come out on the other side with an error describing exactly what went wrong. 🎉🎉🎉\n",
