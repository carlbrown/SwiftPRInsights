      "body": "This fixes a build behaviour change caused by #1012 which in turn was created to fix a behaviour change caused by #873 \r\n\r\n#873 enabled building a static Foundation library. In the build scripts parlance, with this change we had two \"products\" - the dynamic library (`libFoundation.so`) and a new static library (`libFoundation.a`). Build rules for all the \"phases\" and \"dependencies\" were generated both these products and we hence ended in duplicates. This is what #1012 attempted to eliminate.\r\n\r\nBut there was an issue with #1012. With this, build rules for the various dependencies and phases were generated only in  the context of the static library product `libFoundation.a`. These objects generated by these for reused for the dynamic library product `libFoundation.so`. This unintended consequence of this was that dependencies like TestFoundation -> libFoundation.so were not catered to. \r\n\r\nThis led to a behaviour change. While the command 'ninja' built `libFoundation.so`, the command `ninja test` did not. This is not the expected behaviour. We've always had libFoundation.so being built before TestFoundation on the `ninja test` command. \r\n\r\nThis PR rectifies that particular issue in #1012 Instead of generating rules for phases & dependencies in `libFoundation.a` we do that for the product `libFoundation.so` and subsequently reuse them in building `libFoundation.a`. \r\n\r\nIssuing `ninja test` will now build `libFoundation.so` before `TestFoundation`. Issuing `ninja` will build both `libFoundation.so` and `libFoundation.a`.",

This implements the remainder of those updates which had not yet been implemented:\r\n\r\n* For the benefit of unkeyed containers, coding paths currently contain optional `CodingKey`s — unkeyed containers are allowed to report a `nil` key in a path. However, this is unhelpful for debugging purposes, or inspecting the coding path for context, since any unkeyed container simply reports `nil`, whether it’s at index 1 or 1000\r\n\r\n  Now all containers are required to report a non-optional CodingKey for their segment of the coding path, and coding paths are now exposed as `[CodingKey]`\r\n* To support this, `UnkeyedEncodingContainer`s now expose their `count` and `UnkeyedDecodingContainer`s expose their `currentIndex`\r\n\r\n**This PR should not be merged on its own.** This must be merged in simultaneously with apple/swift#10728 and apple/swift#10728 to avoid breaking the build.",

It turns out there is a root certificate authorities file required by libcurl for SSL to work.\r\n\r\nThis PR gives the user the opportunity to provide one and specify it’s location in the environment variable “URLSessionCAInfo” for it to be configured correctly. As providing an absolute path to anything is spectacularly difficult in Android or if the user’s servers are self-signed it also gives the user the option to specify the value “UNSAFE_SSL_NOVERIFY” and SSL hostname verification will not be performed at all.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of an environment variable over increasing the API surface is that the value can come all the way from the Java side of the application where it is most likely to know the path.\r\n\r\nHow does this sound?",
