      "body": "Enabled FastCGI support in Kitura, including documentation changes to README.md.\n## Description\n- Updated Kitura.swift to add add an `addFastCGIServer(onPort port: Int, with delegate: ServerDelegate)` method to enable FastCGI.\n- Added related data structures. \n- Modified the `run()` method in Kitura.swift to start any FastCGI servers configured.\n- Modified the `run()` command to wait on the centralized `ListenerGroup.waitForListeners` rather than calling `HTTPServer.waitForListeners`.\n## Motivation and Context\n\nEnables FastCGI support, per #565 \n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\nMinimal code changes to Kitura. The underlying FastCGI support has been tested via both test units in IBM-Swift/Kitura-net as well as demo code running on swift.codeandstrings.com (tested with various benchmarking tools with Nginx and Apache talking to Kitura over FastCGI).\n\nNginx: http://swift.codeandstrings.com\nApache/mod_proxy_fcgi: http://swift.codeandstrings.com:8080\n\nNote: There is a bug in the current version of the FastCGI code in Kitura-net that affects situations where the web server (connecting to Kitura) is serving content on a port other than port 80 or 443. I've already opened a pull request to correct that problem as well, but this one can go in independently / at the same time.\n\nThe server at http://swift.codeandstrings.com:8080 is running code that includes both this PR and the Kitura-net PR to correct the port issue.\n## Checklist:\n- [x] I have submitted a [CLA form](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/CLA)\n- [x] If applicable, I have updated the documentation accordingly.\n- [ ] If applicable, I have added tests to cover my changes.\n",
