It makes things more complicated (have to add a `subarch` to `Target`, etc), so maybe better just use ArchType only (as I have done here)? \n",

Imports `CoreFoundation` and creates a `pthread_main_np` function that calls it\n\nThe implementation of the `pthread_main_np()` function in `NSOperation` is done as a top level function - that's probably not the right thing to do, but it allows it to be groups with the import of `CoreFoundation`, which is only required to expose `_CFIsMainThread()`. This way its a little more clear why the function is there, and makes it easier to clean up the code if we implement the `pthread_main_np()` shim a better way.\n",
