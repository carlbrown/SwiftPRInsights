While a connection is kept alive, the `HTTPParser` and associated C parser classes are reused for subsequent requests.  The `HTTPParser` and its delegate (the `HTTPIncomingMessage`) form a strong reference cycle.  This causes a leak in the case where the maximum number of keepalive requests is reached, as the process of closing the socket in this scenario neglected to invoke a method (`freeHTTPParser()`) intended to break the cycle.\n\nSee https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura/issues/655\n## Motivation and Context\n\n<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->\n\n<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->\n\nResolves the leak caused by the `HTTPIncomingMessage <-> HTTPParser` reference cycle when keepalive is enabled.\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\n\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\n\n<!--- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\n\nPerformance benchmark run and memory leak no longer seen.\nKitura-net tests run + passing on OSX and Linux.\n## Checklist:\n\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\n\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

      "body": "## Description\n\nKituraNet uses asynchronous I/O on sockets. In that mode writes sometimes only partially write out what was meant to be written. One then needs to wait to be told that there is room in the socket output buffer before writing more bytes. KituraNet does that by buffering the bytes to be written is such cases. \n\nA change was made to the buffering of these bytes that didn't get written out in the first write. This change improved performance by eliminating the use of Data structs and especially creating a new one on every partial write. The current code attempted to keep a single buffer with an index into the buffer.\n\nThe code wasn't completely updated to take into account bytes from the buffer that were already written out.\n## Motivation and Context\n\nFix issue IBM-Swift/Kitura#762\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\nRan KituraNet unit tests. Tested by @carlbrown the reporter of this issue.\n## Checklist:\n- [ ] I have submitted a [CLA form](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/CLA)\n- [ ] If applicable, I have updated the documentation accordingly.\n- [ ] If applicable, I have added tests to cover my changes.\n",
