All requests are read and parsed in there entirety, including the body, before the request is passed to the delegate for handling.\n2. After a request is completely parsed, any subsequent incoming data is read in immediately and buffered for processing after the current request's processing is completed.\n## Motivation and Context\n\nFix the problems in Issues 734 and 686. The code is also simplified and there is a performance boost as well.\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\nHave run the unit tests, TechEmpower, and Blog tests. The latter were run both \"full blast\" and in \"drip mode\".\n## Checklist:\n- [ ] I have submitted a [CLA form](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/CLA)\n- [ ] If applicable, I have updated the documentation accordingly.\n- [ ] If applicable, I have added tests to cover my changes.\n",
