This is causing build failures for the Corelibs XCTest CI on OS X.\n\nUsing `##__VA_ARGS__` (already being used elsewhere in this CoreFoundation) invokes compiler magic which removes the trailing comma in this situation.\n",

      "body": "This PR is to resolve performance bottleneck while converting strings using NSString.data(using:) API concurrently. Performance degradation is exponential to no.of concurrent conversion. This API boils down to __CFGetConverter() function of CFStringEncodingConverter.c\n\n__CFGetConverter returns converter which is costly operation based on the encoding passed. Hence, this function cache converter(s) in static map/dictionary and static double pointer for common case like kCFStringEncodingUTF8, kCFStringEncodingMacRoman | kCFStringEncodingWindowsLatin1, __defaultEncoding. So, it make use of lock(s) to avoid multiple threads working with static variables.\n\n```\nconst _CFEncodingConverter **commonConverterSlot = NULL;\nstatic _CFEncodingConverter *commonConverters[3] = {NULL, NULL, NULL}; // UTF8, MacRoman/WinLatin1, and the default encoding*\nstatic CFMutableDictionaryRef mappingTable = NULL;\n```\n\nBelow is the high-level operations under lock(s) :\n\n```\nlock\n    lookup converter for common case converters (commonConverterSlot)\n    lookup converter from static MutableDictionary (mappingTable)\nunlock\n\nif converter is null, \n    lock\n        lookup converter for common case converters (commonConverterSlot)\n        lookup converter from static MutableDictionary (mappingTable)\n        if converter is null,\n            compute converter and update MutableDictionary or static double pointer\n        end if\n    unlock\nend if\n```\n\nPerformance bottleneck is due to first lookup for converter. This should be relaxed and allow read operation without lock since lookup is done anyway within lock before computing converter. So, it now becomes\n\n```\n//lock\n    lookup converter for common case converters (commonConverterSlot)\n    lookup converter from static MutableDictionary (mappingTable)\n//unlock\n\nif converter is null, \n    lock\n        lookup converter for common case converters (commonConverterSlot)\n        lookup converter from static MutableDictionary (mappingTable)\n        if converter is null,\n            compute converter and update MutableDictionary or static double pointer\n        end if\n    unlock\nend if\n```\n\nLet me know if any comments.\n",
