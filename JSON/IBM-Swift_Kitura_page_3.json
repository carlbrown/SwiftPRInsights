My tests would run through multiple Kitura routes I have created and every 5/6 network requests to these routes, I would get the error `Cannot GET /favicon.ico` causing my test to instantly fail. This issue only appears on Linux web browsers (Chrome/Firefox), but works fine on Mac. The fix for this was simply adding a reference to a favicon.ico and all my tests ran perfectly.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nIt should prevent myself and anyone else from running into this issue. Additionally, its a minor code change that shouldn't affect anything else.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTested on Ubuntu 14.04 using Google Chrome 54.0.2840.71 64-bit primarily.\r\nTested with Kitura 1.0.1\r\nI have tested this on Linux and Mac with the fix mentioned above and it worked properly.\r\nI also tested by creating my own `/public` folder at the root of my project. I added an `index.html` and a `favicon.ico` file which ended up giving me the same results as using the default Kitura static resources. Eventually fails with no favicon reference, and everything works with favicon reference.\r\n\r\n",

I've also modified the multi-part tests to check filename is parsed correctly.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nContent-Disposition can optionally include a `filename` field ([more info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition)), but this was being ignored by `MultiPartBodyParser`. This change reads and stores `filename` if it's present.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n`swift test` passes with no errors. I've modified `testMultipartFormParsing()` to ensure `filename` is being parsed correctly.\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.
