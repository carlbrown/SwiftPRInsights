As long as you don't really need DTDs, validation, or namespaces haha!

Since it's (apparently, it isn't in any public header or documentation anyway) private, are we OK to not use such a structure here?\n\nThere are two test functions I had to disable on Linux because they were segfaulting in swift_dynamicCast. This has something to do with `throw`ing an NSError.\n\nAlso, on OS X, tests were spinning forever on the `NSTask` test, but that's happening for me on an unmodified master branch too, so it's nothing to do with this code!\n",
