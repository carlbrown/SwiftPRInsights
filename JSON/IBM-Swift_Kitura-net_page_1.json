Profiling data that I collected with a simple 'Hello World' Kitura application showed up to 20% of time was being spent in this function due to lock contention, which seems unreasonable.\nThe contention seems to be particularly bad when many small conversion operations are being performed. By reducing the number of individual conversions we perform, we can avoid contention.  Whether the design of __CFGetConverter itself could be improved will be investigated separately.\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\nI rebuilt my sample Kitura application with this change applied to the Kitura-net component.  I observed that it functioned normally when I requested either the default welcome page or my 'hello world' URL.  I did not run any other Kitura tests.\n## Checklist:\n\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\n\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

      "body": "As the title describes, this is a refactoring / renaming of: \n- The HTTPServerDelegate class protocol in Kitura-net to simply ServerDelegate. \n- The IncomingMessage class to HTTPIncomingMessage\n- ServerRequest and ServerResponse into HTTPServerRequest and HTTPServerResponse\n\nThere is also a PR against Kitura to support renaming HTTPServerDelegate\n\nAll of this is in relation to IBM-Swift/Kitura#565 \n## Description\n- Pulled HTTPServerDelegate from the HTTPServer class.\n- Placed it in it's own file, ServerDelegate.swift in Kitura-net.\n- Replaced all uses of HTTPServerDelegate with ServerDelegate system wide. This affects both the Kitura-Net and Kitura projects.\n- Renamed IncomingMessage to HTTPIncomingMessage and updated ClientRequest and ServerRequest accordingly.\n- Renamed ServerResponse to HTTPServerResponse\n- Renamed ServerRequest to HTTPServerRequest\n- Created ServerResponse and ServerRequest class protocols so that other modules (Kitura's Router, specifically) can handle response and requests without understanding the underlying protocol (in preperation for FastCGI addition, which will also use the ServerRequest and ServerResponse protocols)\n- Modified HTTPServer to directly use HTTPServerResponse and HTTPServerRequest\n## Motivation and Context\n\nServerDelegate will ultimately be used to provide server protocols other than HTTP and will be used by a forthcoming pull request related to adding a FastCGI server implementation to Kitura. For clarity, this refactor makes it obvious that the ServerDelegate handles more than HTTP and moves it out of the HTTPServer class in the process.\n\nLikewise, IncomingMessage is related exclusively to HTTP operation. Refactoring it to HTTPIncomingMessage makes this clear.\n\nLikewise, ServerRequest and ServerResponse were previously exclusive to HTTP operation. By refactoring them to HTTP-prefixed classes and leaving class protocols in their places, it's now clear that they are related to the HTTP server and other protocols (FastCGI specifically) can inject themselves using the same request and response system.\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\nChange is relatively trivial in terms of a refactor. Did a full rebuild of current test projects I'm working on and everything builds and runs as always. There is no real code changes here - just renames/refactors  for the most part. The class protocols mirror the public functions in the original classes so these will sit in for the classes in all calling code without issue (unless something breaks in Swift proper).\n## Checklist:\n\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\n\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

      "body": "This PR includes the FastCGI protocol suite for Kitura and generalized the listener group system to support it.\n## Description\n- Added FastCGI classes, all prefixed with FastCGI in the file/class name. These classes are independent of other code.\n- Created ListenerGroup.swift class with some static functionality. Both HTTPServer and FastCGIServer will enqueue their listeners against this new group rather than house their own groups internally.\n- Modified HTTPServer to use ListenerGroup.\n- Added a temporary waitForListeners() method in HTTPServer that simply forwards to the ListenerGroup waitForListeners() method. This allows this PR to Kitura-net to work with the current/tagged version of Kitura without breaking. I'll remove this later once Kitura has been updated to support FastCGI usage.\n\nNote that applications won't be able to add FastCGI listeners until another PR goes through to Kitura that adds an \"addFastCGIServer(onPort, withRouter)\" call. This code is all the dependency code for that future PR.\n## Motivation and Context\n\nImplements core functionality in Kitura-net to support enhancement discussed in IBM-Swift/Kitura#565\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n- Includes test suite for protocol testing proper.\n- Core code has been usage tested on Mac and Linux using Nginx (FastCGI) and Apache (proxy_fcgi) as gateway web servers.\n- Benchmarks (given presence of Keep-Alive) in gateway web server:\n\nKitura HTTP:\n\n```\n$ ab -n 1000 -c 10 -l http://swift.codeandstrings.com:8080/\nRequests per second:    129.46 [#/sec] (mean)\nTime per request:       77.244 [ms] (mean)\n```\n\nKitura FastCGI (Nginx) (No Keep Alive):\n\n```\n$ ab -n 1000 -c 10 -l http://swift.codeandstrings.com/\nRequests per second:    121.42 [#/sec] (mean)\nTime per request:       82.356 [ms] (mean)\n```\n\nKitura FastCGI (Nginx) (Keep Alive to Nginx):\n\n```\n$ ab -n 1000 -c 10 -k -l http://swift.codeandstrings.com/\nRequests per second:    555.32 [#/sec] (mean)\nTime per request:       18.008 [ms] (mean)\n```\n\nNote: All tests over a WAN link to a data centre offsite from my test environment so Internet conditions apply but testing is generally repeatable.\n\nNote: Load testing shows no leaks in Xcode and MacOS (10.11.5) but this code, like Kitura proper, seems to suffer at the hands of [SR-1552](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/380).\n## Checklist:\n\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\n\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

FastCGIServerRequest then suffixes a port number to the URL only if no port is found (in HTTP_HOST) and if the SERVER_PORT is non-standard.\n## Motivation and Context\n\nWithout this patch, web servers running on non-standard ports fail when passing requests to Kitura.\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\nhttp://swift.codeandstrings.com - standard port, Nginx -> FastCGI -> Kitura.\nhttp://swift.codeandstrings.com:8080 - non-stnadard port, Apache -> FastCGI -> Kitura\n\nBoth work as expected now.\n## Checklist:\n\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\n\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

Now returns nil. Reduces NSData allocations non-trivially.\n- Cleaned up code to removed stray self.X and ()'d if conditions (improved readability)\n## Motivation and Context\n\nTuning and cleanup and overall code improvements.\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\nPasses protocol test suite. Also load tested on both OS X and Linux with expected results.\n## Checklist:\n- [x] I have submitted a [CLA form](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/CLA)\n- [ ] If applicable, I have updated the documentation accordingly.\n- [x] If applicable, I have added tests to cover my changes (tests updated)\n",

      "body": "Resolve the issue of being unable to send large payloads back to the client.\n## Description\n\nAdd use of asynchronous socket writes to send the part of the output payload that doesn't get sent by the first write, which returns an errno of EAGAIN. EAGAIN is not an \"error\". It is simply an indication that one should try to send the rest later, when there is more room in the output buffer.\nThe new code uses epoll and DispatchSourceWrite on Linux and macOS, respectively, to determine when there is room in the output buffer. \n## Motivation and Context\n\nResolve issue IBM-Swift/Kitura#678\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\nThis has been tested by adding a test as well as by the originator of the issue in their setup.\n## Checklist:\n- [ ] I have submitted a [CLA form](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/CLA)\n- [ ] If applicable, I have updated the documentation accordingly.\n- [x] If applicable, I have added tests to cover my changes.\n",
