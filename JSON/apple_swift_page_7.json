The patch is written in a way that should only affect generic types, and testing shows that it has not introduced regressions in this area.  The largest changes are to a code path for generic types nested within other types which, as written, could never have worked and in fact led to an immediate assertion.\r\n\r\nThis has been tested only with regression tests.",
