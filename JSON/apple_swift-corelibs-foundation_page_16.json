      "body": "This race condition is a result of a unique sequence of events in the *Foundation-libcurl-libdispatch* interplay. Details of the issue can found [here](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4567). This PR proposes a way to fix that race condition. This wouldn't have been possible without @dgrove-oss 's work on this issue, from the Dispatch angle, and his help on narrowing down on the actual problem at hand. \r\n\r\n**Short description of the issue**\r\nThe URLSession implementation in swift-corelibs-foundation uses libcurl for HTTP support and libdispatch as the events library. There is a unique way in which Foundation, Dispatch and libcurl function and they interplay can lead to race conditions which could cause  a hang or URLSessionTasks timing out with no response. I try to explain this problem in words here. \r\n\r\nWhenever libcurl opens a connection for Foundation, it notifies the latter about the socket it created and the events Foundation should be expecting on that socket, via a callback. So, after making a POST call, for example, libcurl will tell Foundation that I have assigned socket with fd# X(say) and you should track this socket for the read event - because data must be available to read on it in the near future. \r\n\r\nIn response, Foundation registers this socket for the notified event with Dispatch. For example, in the above case, Foundation will tell Dispatch that when a read event occurs on fd# X, please run this handler. The handler typically does the socket reading, during which libcurl will again be invoked. Once the read is over and libcurl thinks there's nothing more to be done on socket with fd# X, it tells Foundation to unregister fd# X from libdispatch.\r\n\r\nFoundation implements the registering and unregistering of fds with libdispatch using the DispatchSource API. On registering for a read, we create a DispatchReadSource and provide an event handler (which will do the socket read eventually). For unregistering, we would want to cancel the DispatchSource. However, the DispatchSource API clearly mentions that a cancel() operation is completed only when a cancel handler is run. See the [documentation of cancel](https://developer.apple.com/reference/dispatch/dispatchsourceprotocol/1780783-cancel).\r\n\r\n**Note**: we did not install a cancel handler before this PR.\r\n\r\nNow, libcurl always tries to reuse connections. So, if one is making a series of API calls to the same endpoint, it is very likely that the same TCP level connection will be reused. There is a provision to have a new connection on every transfer, but that obviously leads to very poor performance. \r\n\r\nGiven this background, when an app is making API calls, back to back, to the same endpoint, we are going to be reusing the same socket (fd) again and again. Then, it is possible that Foundation get an unregister callback immediately followed by a register callback. The unregister callback leads to DispatchSource.cancel() which returns immediately. But the actual epoll_ctl with EPOLL_CTL_DEL happens asynchronously, on a different worker thread. If, after a DispatchSource.cancel() but before the EPOLL_CTL_DEL, libcurl asks us to register the same file descriptor, the EPOLL_CTL_ADD or EPOLL_CTL_MOD goes missing. \r\n\r\nHence, in the interplay of Foundation, libcurl and an epoll-based Dispatch, a unique race condition can lead to a failure to register sockets, effectively leading to a hang or a timeout. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution**\r\nWe've tried half a dozen solutions to fix the race conditions but many of them led to other race conditions. The best solution we're left with is to synchronize the register and unregister operations. An unregister operation is flagged as \"completed\" only when the related \"cancel handler\" runs. Also, the register/unregister code needs to be moved to a queue different from the MultiHandle workqueue to avoid a certain deadlock condition. ",

Writing to the `int64_t` overwrote some of `malloc`'s internal bookkeeping information and caused a crash.\r\n\r\nI changed the code to use a couple of `sizeof`s to calculate the extra space to allocate, like the rest of CoreFoundation does (see [this search](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/search?utf8=âœ“&q=_CFRuntimeCreateInstance&type=)).",
