      "body": "This PR was created to allow errors thrown in the adapter to call the retrier before starting up the request's internal dispatch queue. \n## Problem\n\nThe reason this is necessary is if you want to be able to throw an `ExpiredAccessToken` type of `Error` in your `RequestAdapter`. This would allow you to do things like preemptively refresh you token before sending any requests to the server even though the public APIs had already started up the request. The adapter would be able to intervene.\n\n> See #1674 for the a more in-depth explanation of the issue.\n## Solution\n\nOkay everyone (especially @jshier), I need a sanity check here. I don't think this is too hackish, but I want to make sure everyone else agrees. This was really tricky to implement since there are so many different things going on.\n\nThe biggest decision was whether or not to wrap the errors in the `AdaptError` or not. It all boils down to whether we should call the retrier for things like invalid URLs and parameter encoding failures. IMO, we should not. I feel like calling the retrier in those scenarios could cause all sorts of problems where people are accidentally getting themselves into endless retry scenarios without realizing it.\n\nInstead, I created an `AdaptError` to wrap any `Error` that's thrown by the `RequestAdapter`. This is only used internally by Alamofire to figure out whether the encountered error was actually thrown by the `adapter` or not. If it is an `AdaptError`, extract the underlying `Error` and call the `retrier`. If it isn't an `AdaptError`, then the request isn't going to succeed and just start up the request queue.\n\nWe could instead actually expose an `AFError.adaptError` that people are required to throw to get this behavior, but that seems a bit odd and easy to misuse. Instead, I think people are going to want to throw all types of errors from the adapter and we should just wrap them up internally to figure out whether or not we should call the retrier. Once we make that decision, we extract the underlying error and continue on.\n\nI haven't actually built any tests around this yet because I wanted to get everyone's thoughts first. I've dug into the download and upload requests a bit and this is definitely possible to support in a similar manner.\n\nThoughts?\n",
