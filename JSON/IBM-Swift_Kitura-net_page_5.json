I believe that the crash is caused by corruption of an IncomingSocketHandler instance, possibly as consequence of a concurrency problem.  Adding a 'sacrificial' field that is not an Object (and thus not retained / released) seems to be sufficient to avoid this crash and has not (in the testing I have done) introduced any further consequences.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI ran the 'HelloMiddleware' benchmark a number of times.  It crashes around 5/6ths of the time without this change.  With it, I have not yet seen a crash.",
