      "body": "- **Explanation**: If a Swift library contains an extension of Objective-C type `A` that has a method that mentions Objective-C type `A.B` (using the \"import-as-member\" feature), performing the lookup to find `A.B` can lead to a circular dependency between deserialization and the importer, which resulted in a compiler crash. This is not a new problem, but it's more important with the release of Swift 4, where a number of Apple SDK types are now newly imported as member types. (The one in the original bug was NSView.AutoresizingMask, formerly NSAutoresizingMaskOptions.) This change adds a \"fast path\" for direct lookup of a single, unambiguous type nested in an Objective-C type.\r\n- **Scope**: Affects references in Swift to nested types imported from Objective-C.\r\n- **Issue**: [SR-5284](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5284) / rdar://problem/32926560\r\n- **Reviewed by**: @milseman (ClangImporter), @jckarter (Serialization)\r\n- **Risk**: Medium-low. These types are not uncommon, but this is just a \"fast path\"; it should fall back to the old code if it fails.\r\n- **Testing**: Added regression tests, verified that the original test case now passes, passed the source compatibility suite on master.",

      "body": "Cherry pick of #10958 onto the 4.0 branch.\r\n\r\n* Explanation: When fast-pathing in-place slice mutation, bounds check the slice's ranges match exactly. In-place mutation of an array slice doesn't need assigning back, but there needs to be a check that the assigned slice's bounds matches otherwise unmatched range assignments like `a[1..<1] = a[1..<2]` were getting thrown away.\r\n* Scope of Issue: Correctness fix\r\n* Risk: Minimal. This is checking for a potential no-op fast path. When the check fails, the full `replaceRange` method is called, writing the slice into the collection in full. This is what is desired in this case.\r\n* Reviewed By: Dave Abrahams\r\n* Testing: Automated test suite + new tests for this case\r\n",
