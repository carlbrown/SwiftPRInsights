The test is written in a way that did not add the x86_64 target to the command line and would therefore fail on arm64.\r\n\r\n• Scope of Issue: Failing test case because the test case is not narrow enough\r\n\r\n• Origination: Recently introduced \r\n\r\n• Risk: Low. This is a fix to a test case.\r\n\r\n• Testing: The test case was fixed and should no longer fail during regression tests running on non x86_64 archs\r\n\r\n\r\nrdar://33376164\r\n\r\n",
