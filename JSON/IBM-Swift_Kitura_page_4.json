      "body": "The `send(json:)` method of `RouterResponse` attempts to convert a SwiftyJSON object into a `Data` object using `rawData(options:.prettyPrinted)`. This is a throwing method, but in the current code nothing happens if an error is thrown. This patch calls `Log.warning()` to write a message to the logger, if there is one. Given that the user is attempting to send data and it's failing, `warning` seems like an appropriate log level.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nI've added one line of code to `send(json:)` that logs the following string at \"warning\" level: `\"Failed to convert JSON for sending: \\(error.localizedDescription)\"`.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nI lost 30 minutes of my evening because send(json:) was silently failing. It may be worth considering whether `send(json:)` should itself be a throwing method, but in the meantime adding a warning should help others who hit the same problem.\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] I have submitted a [CLA form](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/CLA)\r\n\r\n",

In some cases the closures used to implement these hooks cause object reference loops. This in turn causes memory leaks. \r\n\r\nThis PR provides a set of functions to reset the life cycle functions each back to their initial value, a no-op function. This breaks the reference loop and fixes the memory leak.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nFix issue IBM-Swift/Kitura#879\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n@djones6 Ran memory leak tests and verified the leaks went away.\r\nI also ran the Kitura unit tests on both macOS and Linux.\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [ ] I have submitted a [CLA form](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/CLA)\r\n- [ ] If applicable, I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n- [ ] If applicable, I have added tests to cover my changes.\r\n",

      "body": "`BodyParser` should default a `ParsedBody.raw(Data)` when the `Content-Type` isn't known.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n`BodyParser` has a [`parserMap`](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura/blob/master/Sources/Kitura/bodyParser/BodyParser.swift#L31-L34) which designates that text-based `Content-Type`s correspond to a specialized parser (e.g., `application/json` -> `JSONBodyParser`).\r\n\r\nIf the `Content-Type` was not any of those types, it would fall-through and `nil` out the data from the `RouterRequest` instead of storing the raw data in [`.raw(Data)`](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura/blob/master/Sources/Kitura/bodyParser/ParsedBody.swift#L42) on `ParsedBody`.\r\n\r\nI fixed this by following pattern and creating `RawBodyParser` which just slots the data into `.raw(Data)`. `BodyParser` now defaults to passing the RouterRequest body into `RawBodyParser`.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nThis is in response to [Issue 908](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura/issues/908). While exploring @rfdickerson's [Kitura Protobuf Sample](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-Protobuf-Sample), I notice that `POST`ing did not work when sending a protobuf file. The `RouterRequest`'s body was `nil` not `application/json`. @rfdickerson [assumed](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-Protobuf-Sample/commit/0475ab18045593e9d5a0b9fff511ce4c5adf2f8d#diff-c59d9b61114ad3468cfbb3a6a44fa297L59), as I would have, that the body could have been accessed using `.raw(Data)` on the `ParsedBody`. This was not the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI wrote a unit test that tests whether raw data being sent passes through the `router` properly and can be accessed using `.raw(Data)`.\r\n\r\nI only ran tests locally on Mac OS X since I do not have access to a Linux environment immediately.\r\n\r\nThis would only have impact on existing code if the end user _knew_ that `BodyParser` would `nil` out the body and wrote against that scenario.\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] I have submitted a [CLA form](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/CLA)\r\n- [x] If applicable, I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n- [x] If applicable, I have added tests to cover my changes.\r\n",

I ran local performance tests to establish that performance recovers to the level we had at Kitura 1.2.0 (as long as query parameters are not accessed).",
