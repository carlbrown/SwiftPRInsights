There is an associated pull request with the small change https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4662 to build-script-impl in the swift project to pass through the required arguments to the ninja scritpt generator. The focus has been on getting the code to  compile but preliminary testing of Regular expressions, NSHost, fetching Strings from URLs has been successful so far. There is a known issue with needing to hook thread exit to call JNI method DetachCurrentThread which I’ll have to look at before making a PR on swift-corelibs-libdispatch (resolved, see below).\n\nIssues found and not resolved:\nOptimising the creation of a string from zero length data - optimisation patched out for now\nFetching the current Locale language for web fetch request headers - also patched out\n\nChanges tested on Linx and OSX build. Included is a minor change fixing a missing -lcurl when building \"util/build-script —foundation\" on Linux.\n\nAs foundation has binary dependencies on libxml2 and libcurl and it's not been able to automate the libdispatch crosscompile the build is dependent on a pre-built binary & header package downloaded by a series of scripts in the swift-corelibs-foundation/android directory. These binaries were built from the public repos pretty much as-is after some Makefilery. Details are in the README.md in this directory.\n",

I'll look at fixing that separately. \n",
