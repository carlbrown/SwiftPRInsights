In the code for the StaticServer middleware add a check for the Kitura repository being under .build/checkouts in addition to possibly being under Packages. These checks are done to find the root of the original repository, when the current directory at execution time is something different.\r\n\r\n  2. In the code that serves the \"landing page\", there is code that searches for the resources dircetory which is primarily used when running on Bluemix. In this code a check was added to include looking for the Kitura resources directory under .build/checkouts as well as Packages.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nSwift 3.1 by default checks out dependent repositories under ./.build/checkouts. However if one does a `swift package edit .....` on a dependent repository, that repository would be under Packages.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThe unit tests of both Kitura and Kitura-Sample have been both run.\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [ ] I have submitted a [CLA form](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/CLA)\r\n- [ ] If applicable, I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n- [ ] If applicable, I have added tests to cover my changes.\r\n",

What problem does it solve? -->\r\n<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->\r\nWith the release of **Swift 3.1**, the `Packages` directory is no longer included, and for backwards compatibility it now checks in both `Packages` and `.build/checkouts` in order to locate the index file.  With the `.build` directory no longer being removed, the file should have been found, but error caused by the missing `Packages` folder terminated the loop before it would check the `.build` directory.  This logic has been reformatted to try to find the file inside the `for` loop.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!--- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nThis changes were tested locally using `swift build` & `swift test`, and in Frankfurt Bluemix.  In order to test that my changes worked in Bluemix, I created a 1.7.3 tag (deleted after testing) and pointed to this fork for downloading Kitura in my Package.swift.  This was tested against a [development branch](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/swift-buildpack/tree/issue.cache) of the Swift buildpack , which no longer removes the `.build` directory.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-04-27 at 6 08 14 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18534315/25508780/11b54150-2b7a-11e7-8aa0-7e50cc558e53.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.
