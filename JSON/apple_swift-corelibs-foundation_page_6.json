This transformation was performed mechanically using the following sed script (run with `sed -E`):\n\n```\n/(init|mutating|struct|enum|typealias|final|let|static)/ {\n  p\n  d\n}\n/public class/,/^}/ s/public/open/\n```\n\nThis should probably be refined soon, but for now this allows us to implement SE-0117 without immediately requiring updates in all clients. Specifically, there are two areas where this change may not be correct to match Foundation on Apple platforms:\n- Members in extensions cannot yet be overridden, so none of them have been marked `open`.\n- Some classes are _not_ intended to be overridden, even in Objective-C. Specifying this requires input from the Foundation team.\n\nGroundwork for SE-0117 \"Allow distinguishing between public access and public overridability\"\n",

This test did not fail on Linux or on the regular CoreFoundation project because on those platforms, CFDateFormatter defaults to a locale of \"en_US\" (still wrong, but it works); here, a locale of \"\" caused the failing test. A fix for this incorrect default is forthcoming in CF itself.\n",
