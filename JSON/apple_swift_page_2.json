This allows Data initialization to take the fast path in a select group of initializations; previously it would create a Data and then iterate byte by byte appending. Albeit that was relatively quick, we have faster options available.\r\n\r\nThis addresses the issue:\r\nrdar://problem/32359974\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\nCollection had some pretty slow (comparatively) default initializers for Data. This gives faster paths for common cases.\r\n\r\nScope:\r\nThis only applies to `Data.init(_ :)` type initializers for collections.\r\n\r\nRadar (and possibly SR Issue):\r\nrdar://problem/32359974\r\n\r\nRisk:\r\nThis is a pretty commonly used initializer for Data. It could have a potential of causing different access patterns to be hit in client code passing in custom adopters of collection.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\nAdditional unit tests were added to validate the correctness of this patch.\r\n",

It provides additional information about what digits are expected (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal)\r\n3.
