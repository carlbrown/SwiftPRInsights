These diagnostics were being output as they were generated, which was suboptimal because it meant that NOTEs could be produced before the error they were related to.\r\n\r\nThis was bad for consumers like Xcode, which associate NOTEs with the last error or warning diagnostic. If the only error in produced was a diagnostic from Codable synthesis, the initial NOTEs would be lost in the Xcode UI.\r\n\r\nThis collates these notes using a diagnostic transaction and only outputs the errors if something actually goes wrong.",
