This is a regression from Swift 3.\r\n**Radar**: rdar://problem/32287795\r\n**Risk**: Low-ish. The fix itself is a bit hacky, but the risk is mitigated because the change only kicks in for those cases where the compiler will currently crash.\r\n**Testing**: Compiler regression testing, built the medium-sized project that demonstrated the regression and makes extensive use of these features, added test cases reduced from said project.",

Escalate the warning to an error *even in Swift 3.2 mode* to close this type hole, because it's better to reject a program than crash trying to compile it. \r\n**Scope**: We know of one project that will start to be rejected in Swift 3.2 mode because of this change, because that project is (unintentionally) exploiting the type soundness hole. Today, that project can only compile as Swift 3.2 and only with the optimizers turned off.\r\n**Radar**: rdar://problem/28601761\r\n**Risk**: Very low.
