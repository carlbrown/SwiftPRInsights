I removed the dependency of getting initial `n` value, because `first` and `last` will be equal after zooming a lot\n2. I change `centerAxisLabelsEnabled` condition, if entry count > 0, we could turn on centerAxisLabel. I need context why it's `> 1`.\n3. I removed using local variable `centeringEnabled`, because `axis.entries` would be changed but `centeringEnabled` keeps reading old entryCount, which seems a dirty read issue\n4. I use `offset: Double = interval / 2.0` instead of `offset = (axis.entries[1] - axis.entries[0]) / 2.0`, because `axis.entries[1] - axis.entries[0]` always equals to interval, and when there is only one entry, we still need a valid offset instead of 0\n",
