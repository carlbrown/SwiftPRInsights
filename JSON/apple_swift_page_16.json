But, given the corner case in the linked radar, it is necessary to rewrite one particular kind of pattern to better suit the Space Engine.  This patch rewrites patterns that match enum cases with associated arguments to patterns with wildcards if the associated arguments are left unmatched by the user.  This enables a number of logic cleanups and simplifications in addition to unblocking the project in the radar.\r\n• Risk: Low.\r\n• Reviewed By: Joe Groff\r\n• Testing: Existing regression tests updated, new tests added.\r\n• Radar URL: rdar://32549000 ",
