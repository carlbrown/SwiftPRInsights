      "body": "This is an alternative approach to the existing branch system w/ very few modifications.  In current performance metrics, the original implementation takes over 35% longer.  The speed bonus can be useful in routing multiple requests and maintaining efficiency.  The structure I added is very close to the original, also based on a trie, but the lookup is done in a linked fashion by traversing a branch as opposed to a search which is where most of the boost appears to derive.\n## Performance\n### Branch Router - 1.513\n\n![screen shot 2016-02-20 at 2 49 41 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5750489/13198858/2c992fd2-d7e2-11e5-9bf7-e4d0e5d3aa30.png)\n### Node Router - 2.094\n\n![screen shot 2016-02-20 at 2 53 19 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5750489/13198857/27c0cd9e-d7e2-11e5-9aa3-5d251007596a.png)\n## Changes\n#### Request Handler\n- Renamed `Closure` to `RequestHandler` having it represent: `Request throws -> ResponseConvertible`.  I think this naming aids in clarity of intent.  It also might be worth nesting w/in request so it's `Request.Handler`.  I like both\n#### Node Router\n\nBecomes just Router and interfaces more directly with branches allowing request to forward outward recursively\n#### Branch\n\nReplace route, renamed to branch to be more symbolic about the linked structure.\n#### RouterDriver\n\nSlightly reworked protocol.  It is no longer necessary for the router to convert its throwing functions internally, instead allowing the Server to take care of it since it's doing it anyway. Removed optionality of `hostname` opting for default argument of `\"*\"` which feels a bit more _swifty_. We could also write an overload in RouterDriver extension that builds in the default to the protocol programmatically. The functions are converted at handle time as opposed to server start which allows us to omit the need for `register` and makes custom routers more convenient.\n\n``` Swift\npublic protocol RouterDriver {  \n  func route(request: Request) -> (Request -> Response)?        \n  func register(hostname hostname: String?, method: Request.Method, path: String, handler: (Request -> Response))   \n}\n```\n\nBecomes\n\n``` Swift\npublic protocol RouterDriver {\n    func route(request: Request) -> RequestHandler?\n    func register(hostname hostname: String, method: Request.Method, path: String, handler: RequestHandler)\n}\n```\n#### Global `Route`\n\nThe global `Route` accessor moves from class functions to an instance.  This allows for a couple of main things.  This does not affect familiar syntax in any way.\n- No need to register a router driver with the routes, instead the router driver is self contained\n- Allows the global `Route` object to be injected as a default which makes it easier for custom routers to be added if desired\n### Syntax Implications\n\nThis would only affect users who created a default `RouterDriver` in which case, conversions should be extremely light.  All other syntax remains identical to end user\n### ToDo\n- [x] Integrate branch / router\n- [x] Run performance tests\n- [x] Confirm feature and expectation parity (does it run the same way and produce the same results) -- confirm w/ Tanner\n- [x] Add `Controller` support back\n- [x ] Cleanup\n- [x] Rename `AltRouter` to `Router` -- named `Alt` during testing for easier distinction\n",
